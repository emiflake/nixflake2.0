My home-manager and nix configuration files.

This repo is used in all of the devices where I use nix. Due to the architecture of home-manager modules, it is possible to pick and choose which modules to include and exclude where. As a result, this works in NixOS, Ubuntu, Darwin on M1, WSL2 and the Steam deck.

I will not put effort into documenting this, but feel free to ask me about anything whenever.
